	o perl/tk pod  and tcl/tk conflicts !!!!!!!!!!!

		* optionMenu

		* where is after.n is it merged as POD in Tk::After.pm

	o When L<show this|man/section is accepted:

		o ask Nick: Okay to include modified pod2man?
		o     Tom: Okay that Nick includes modified pod2man?

		o Modify STANDARD OPTIONS:

			  (tix versus tk convention)
			* use B<L<whatever|ptkOptions/Name: whatever>>
		   Note L<> dependend
			* use consistently whatever or -whatever
			* add -class when not listed
			* consitent sorting some l-r first other up-down first
			* check if everything in STD OPT is realy listed there?

		o check \w+Cmd command option to link callback -> L<callback|ptkCallbacks>

		o modify SEE ALSO

		o replace \fBwhatever\fR or L<whatever.pod> with
		  L<whatever|Tk::Whatever>
		

        o check /path name|pathname/i

	o Generate L<> in mann for Tk_GetPixels, Tk_GetBitmap, Tk_GetColor,
	  Tk_GetBoolean, Tk_ConfigureInfo.  Are other Tk_[A-Z]\w  ?

	o fix whatever(n|3) remnants (or another tkman2pod try?)

	o check $widget remnants instead of $whatever

	o new event and font pages:  Method names etc. should
	  be converted from tcl -> perl

	o 'Normal' callback

		[ $obj, 'method', ...]

	  not documented (tested with Button -command). So is this
	  true for all callbacks?

	o  Diff 'Normal' and 'bind' callback

	     Button(-command=>'subname') -> Tk::Button::subname()

	  (misleading documented in callback manpage) but

	     $button->bind(<whatever>, 'method') -> $button->method

	  Too late to change that 'normal' works like 'bind' callback?


        o grep for EXAMPLE and translate the to perl/Tk

	o EXAMPLE in DItem.n is in TCL. Learn how to translate it :-)

	o Check standard option: Tk4.2 pages use resource name
	  Tk8.0 uses option name as first item. (I think)

	o Tcl remnant I saw:

	  * choseColors.n  button .b in EXAMPLE section
	  * event.n          needs hand tuning
	  * getopenFile.n    "     "    "
	  * loadTk	     applicable? Doc Rewrite?
	  * tk.n 		is plain tcl  (replace with my
				incomplete version in Tk.pm?)

	  o dialog.n  describes tcl version
	  o mesageBox "
	  o popup
