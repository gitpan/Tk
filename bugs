9/26/95 (new feature) Added -sliderrelief option to scales, changed
default bindings to change the slider's relief to sunken while it's
being dragged with the mouse. (JO)

8/30/95 (new features) Added proper button 2 support to both scrollbars
and scales (it sets the slider position from the mouse position). (JO)

10/30/95 (bug fix) When focus-follows-mode (invoked via tk_focusFollowsMouse),
was focussing on windows even in situations where keyboard traversal would
skip the window.  Changed to use the tkFocusOK procedure so that the
criteria for focussing are the same in both modes. (JO)
