KNOWN BUGS not covered by the test suite:

t/HList.t (tobe)

	o nearest  gives 'TCL panic' and aborts

t/font.t (tobe)

	o $w->fontMeasure(), fontMeasure($f) gives SEGV on
	  AIX V3.whatwasit and Linux (Stephen)

	o warnings:
		o	'ont' instead of 'font'
		o	-displayof removed from doc but still
			in error message

t/Text.t

	o windowCreate expects pathname instead of widget ref

	o windowNames	returns list of pathnames instead of
	  widget refs

t/widget.t

	o pathname of Pathname method not implemented yet


--------------------------

MISSING features of the test suite


general

	o add more tests, More Tests, MORE TESTS.

	o create utility functions for the test. Especially
	  a set of standard test that all widget has to pass
	  to call itself a widget.

	o better error messages so reporting problems gets
	  easier.

t/create.t

	o LabRadio.pm creates LabRadiobutton class. So it's not
	  tested here

	o create 'skip' logic (see Test::Harness). So if e.g.,
	  widget creation fails that exits, pack, destroy are
	  skipped.

	o Add 'expected to fail' logic for known but pending
	  bugs so we don't get same error again and again.
