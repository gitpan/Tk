This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.0.5 (Scriptics's production release). 

It also includes all the C code parts of Ioi Kim Lam's Tix4.1.0.006 release.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

This version (Tk800.016) requires perl5.005 or later on Win32 
and 5.004_04 or later on UNIX.

This version also contains re-worked Image code based on tcl/tk Img extension
(version img1.2b2) by Jan Nijtmans: http://members1.chello.nl/~j.nijtmans/ 
Jan's "dash" patch is also merged.

Tk800.016 should build and run on Windows NT using Visual C++, Borland, 
or with the Mingw32 port of GCC with perl5.005 or later.
Can be built using ActiveState's binrary distribution 
(see README-ActiveState.txt).

The Mingw32 builds are stable now.

I have not tried a Borland build recently.

Goal of 800.* is to incorporate native look-and-feel to Win32 port introduced
in tk8.0 while retaining as much of the perl-level API as it exists in Tk40?.*
as possible.
