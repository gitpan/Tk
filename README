Tk804.023 is alpha code.
(Previous stable release being Tk804.024.)

C code is derived from Tcl/Tk8.4a2.
Perl API is essentially the same as Tk804.024 but has not
been verified as compliant, so I have left it as .023.

The goal of this release is Unicode support via perl's and core-tk's use
of UTF-8.

This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.4.

It also includes all the C code parts of Tix4.1.3 from SourceForge.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

This Tk804 is only likely to work with perl5.7.3+ and Encode-1.33+
(i.e. perl5.8 tobe).

Back port to perl5.6* (with reduced functionality) _may_ occur one day.

Win32 does not build at all yet.

Author has built against:

  Perl5.7.3, DEVEL15844
   Pentium Suse Linux-6.4 gcc-2.95.2
