Hopefully Tk800.019 is still production worthy but consider
it a late beta - Tk800.015 is latest stable release.

This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.0.5 (Scriptics's production release).

It also includes all the C code parts of Ioi Kim Lam's Tix4.1.0.006 release.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

>>> TK IS KNOWN NOT TO WORK WITH perl5.005_63 <<<
- Does work with 5.005_64-to-be as of 7 Jan 2000
- Sometimes fails with 5.6.0-RC1 ("unparsable float")

This version (Tk800.019) requires perl5.005 or later on Win32
and 5.004_04 or later on UNIX.

This version also contains re-worked Image code based on tcl/tk Img extension
(version img1.2b2) by Jan Nijtmans: http://members1.chello.nl/~j.nijtmans/
Jan's "dash" patch is also merged.

Tk800.019 should build and run on Windows NT using Visual C++, Borland,
or with the Mingw32 port of GCC with perl5.005 or later.
Can be built using ActiveState's binrary distribution
(see README-ActiveState.txt).

The Mingw32 builds are stable now using older Mingw32s.
There are perl build issues with very new Mingw32 (2.95.*).

I have not tried a Borland build recently.

Goal of 800.* is to incorporate native look-and-feel to Win32 port introduced
in tk8.0 while retaining as much of the perl-level API as it exists in Tk40?.*
as possible.

Author has built against:
  Perl5.00503
   SPARC Solaris2.6, gcc-2.8.1
   Pentium Suse Linux-6.1 egcs-1.1.2

  Perl5.00404
   Pentium Suse Linux-6.1 egcs-1.1.2
