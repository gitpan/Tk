This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk4.2p2 (John Ousterhout's production
release).  

It also includes all the C code parts of Ioi Kim Lam's Tix4.1.0.003 release.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

This version (Tk402.001) requires perl5.003 or later.
I strongly recommend using 5.004 or 5.004_01.

THIS VERSION IS AN ALPHA TRACK - I.E. FOR THOSE ASSISTING IN DEBUGGING PERL/TK,
NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE.  INTERFACES AND CONTENT SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND
MAY PARTS BE NON-FUNCTIONAL.

Tk400.202 is the current "production" release - see VERSIONS

Tk402.001 should build and run on Windows NT using Visual C++ and perl5.004_01.
I also believe I have incorporated contributed fixes to allow build with Borland
compiler on NT.

Goal of 402.* is to retain perl-level API as it exists in Tk400.200
production release.

However as internals have changed I am uncertain that everything "works"
correctly.  The movement of event loop out of tk4.1 into Tcl was 
particularly messy to move "back".

I hope to have an event loop in perl and or XSUB code for 402's production
release.
