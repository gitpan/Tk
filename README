This version is essentially that demonstrated at the 2nd Perl Conference.

This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.0p2 (John Ousterhout's production
release).            

It also includes all the C code parts of Ioi Kim Lam's Tix4.1.0.006 release.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

This version also contains re-worked Image code based on tcl/tk Img extension 
by Jan Nijtmans <nijtmans@worldaccess.nl>

This version (Tk800.011) requires perl5.005 or later on Win32 
and 5.004_04 or later on UNIX.

Tk800.011 should build and run on Windows NT using Visual C++, Borland, 
or with the EGCS-1.0.2 Mingw32 port of GCC with perl5.005 or later.
Note that the 2.8.0 Mingw32 port does not work, because the GUI parts of the 
include files and import libraries supplied with it are not correct enough
to build Tk. The 2.8.1 port may work I have not tried it yet.

Goal of 800.* is to incorporate native look-and-feel to Win32 port introduced
in tk8.0 while retaining as much of the perl-level API as it exists in Tk40?.*
as possible.
