Tk800.022 is supposed to be production worthy.
It has minimal changes from Tk800.021 apart from bug fixes.

(Consider Tk800.016..Tk800.021 its beta releases, previous stable
release being Tk800.015.)

This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.0.5 (Scriptics's production release).

It also includes all the C code parts of Ioi Kim Lam's Tix4.1.0.006 release.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

>>> TK IS KNOWN NOT TO WORK WITH perl5.005_63 <<<
But does work with perl5.6.0 - although this required a couple of work-rounds
for perl5.6.0 ->isa bug.

This version (Tk800.022) requires perl5.005 or later on Win32
and 5.004_04 or later on UNIX.

This version also contains re-worked Image code based on tcl/tk Img extension
(version img1.2.3) by Jan Nijtmans: http://members1.chello.nl/~j.nijtmans/
Jan's "dash" patch is also merged.

Tk800.022 should build and run on Windows NT using Visual C++, Borland,
or with the Mingw32 port of GCC with perl5.005 or later.
Can be built using ActiveState's binrary distribution
(see README-ActiveState.txt).

The Mingw32 builds are stable now using older Mingw32s.
There are perl build issues with very new Mingw32 (2.95.*).

I have not tried a Borland build recently.
