This version is a (late) beta. I some respects code is in better shape
than Tk40? series. But I still expect to tweak it some more.

This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.0p2 (John Ousterhout's production
release).            

It also includes all the C code parts of Ioi Kim Lam's Tix4.1.0.005 release.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

This version also contains re-worked Image code based on tcl/tk Img extension 
by Jan Nijtmans <nijtmans@worldaccess.nl>

This version (Tk800.005) requires perl5.004_02 or later.
Some of Tk::IO and 'fileevent' programly won't work without 
Graham Barr's TIEHANDLE patches e.g. perl5.004_62

Tk800.005 should build and run on Windows NT using Visual C++, or 
Borland with and perl5.004_6X.

Goal of 800.* is to incorporate native look-and-feel to Win32 port introduced
in tk8.0 while retaining as much of the perl-level API as it exists in Tk40?.*
as possible.
