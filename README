This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk4.2p2 (John Ousterhout's production
release).  

It also includes all the C code parts of Ioi Kim Lam's Tix4.1.0.005 release.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

This version also contains re-worked Image code based on tcl/tk Img extension 
by Jan Nijtmans <nijtmans@worldaccess.nl>

This version (Tk402.004) requires perl5.004 or later.
(Actually 5.003 will probably work on UNIX platforms if requires are 
 downgraded, but not on Win32.)
I strongly recommend using 5.004_04.

In addition this version has had some testing under perl5.004_5X, and 
various 'use English' constucts of form $ARG and @ARG have been removed
to allow co-existance with threads. 

_One_ Tk app. ran under threaded perl without crashing, but this is not in 
any way to be taken as saying that Tk is thread safe. I am fairly sure it
is NOT thread safe. (Due to core tk4.2.)

THIS VERSION IS BETA - I.E. FOR THOSE ASSISTING IN DEBUGGING PERL/TK,
NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE.  INTERFACES AND CONTENT SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND
PARTS MAY BE NON-FUNCTIONAL.

Tk400.202 is the current "production" release - see VERSIONS

Tk402.004 should build and run on Windows NT using Visual C++ and perl5.004_04.
I also believe I have incorporated contributed fixes to allow build with Borland
compiler on NT.

Goal of 402.* is to retain perl-level API as it exists in Tk400.200
production release.

However as internals have changed I am uncertain that everything "works"
correctly.  The movement of event loop out of tk4.1 into Tcl was 
particularly messy to move "back".

I hope to have an event loop in perl and or XSUB code for 402's production
release.
