This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk4.2p2 (John Ousterhout's production
release).  This version (Tk402.000) requires perl5.003 or later.
I stronly recommend using perl5.003_99 (gama release) or 5.004 itself.

THIS VERSION IS AN ALPHA TRACK - I.E. FOR THOSE ASSISTING IN DEBUGGING PERL/TK,
NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE.  INTERFACES AND CONTENT SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND
MAY PARTS BE NON-FUNCTIONAL.

Tk400.202 is the current "production" release - see VERSIONS

Tk402.000 should build and run on Windows NT using Visual C++ and perl5.003_99.


Goal of 402.* is to retain perl-level API as it exists in Tk400.200
production release.

However as internals have changed I am uncertain that everything "works"
correctly.  The movement of event loop out of tk4.1 into Tcl was 
particularly messy to move "back".

I hope to have an event loop in perl and or XSUB code for 402's production
release.
