Tk804.025 is beta level.
(Previous stable release being Tk800.025.)
The code itself is probably at least as solid as Tk800 series, but
build process/tests need shaking down on non/Linux.

This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.4.
C code is derived from Tcl/Tk8.4.5.

Perl API is essentially the same as Tk800.025 but has not
been verified as compliant.

The goal of this release is Unicode support via perl's and
core-tk's use of UTF-8.

It also includes all the C code parts of Tix8.1.4 from SourceForge.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

This Tk804 is only likely to work with perl5.8+
Perl's UTF-8 support has improved since int was introduced in perl5.6.0.
Some functions (regular expression match in Text widgets) are known
to only work with perl5.8.1 and later

Author has built against:

  Perl5.8.0
   Earlier versions worked with this - but it has Unicode mis-features.
   Not tried it recently.

   Note that on RedHat Linux in particular the build process must be
   done in a non UTF-8 locale i.e. LANG=en_GB not LANG=en_GB.utf8
   (This is due to bugs in perl5.8.0 as shipped by RedHat.)

  Perl5.8.1
   Pentium Suse Linux-8.2 gcc-3.3
   Visual C++ 6.0, Windows-XP, dmake/nmake
   Mingw 2.0, Windows-XP, dmake  (perl without PERL_IMP_SYS, that is
   broken for MinGW).
   ActivePerl based on 5.8.1 also works with Visual C++ 6.0/nmake

  Perl5.8.2
   Pentium Suse Linux-8.2/9.0 gcc-3.3
   Visual C++ 6.0, Windows-XP, dmake/nmake

An experimental implementation of client side fonts via
freetype2, fontconfig and Xft is provided for Unix.
This is strongly recommened if you are planning to make use
of Unicode rendering capabilities of Tk. It also gives anti-aliased
fonts for regular text (if you have TrueType or Type1 fonts and
they are in your fontconfig config file).

See http://fontconfig.org

The author has installed
  http://fontconfig.org/release/xrender-0.8.3.tar.gz
  http://fontconfig.org/release/xft-2.1.2.tar.gz
  http://fontconfig.org/release/fontconfig-2.2.0.tar.gz

but it also works with versions in SuSE8.2

To try this install those libraries (or later ones?) and then do
  perl Makefile.PL XFT=1
