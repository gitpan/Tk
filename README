---------------------------------------------------------------------------
pTk sub-directory is a modified version of Tk4.0p1

It has been modified to call "glue" functions rather than use libtcl.a - so it
is completely independant of TCL.

A goal is to have pTk directory and its library usable from 
perl/Tcl/LISP/c++/python etc.  - perl is 1st.

There are still serious snags with the others.
