This version is a (late) beta. I some respects code is in better shape
than Tk40? series. But I still expect to tweak it some more.

This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.0p2 (John Ousterhout's production
release).            

It also includes all the C code parts of Ioi Kim Lam's Tix4.1.0.006 release.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

This version also contains re-worked Image code based on tcl/tk Img extension 
by Jan Nijtmans <nijtmans@worldaccess.nl>

This version (Tk800.007) requires perl5.004_02 or later.
Some of Tk::IO and 'fileevent' programly won't work without 
Graham Barr's TIEHANDLE patches e.g. perl5.004_62

Tk800.007 should build and run on Windows NT using Visual C++, Borland, 
or (a 1st for .007) with the EGCS-1.0.2 Mingw32 port of GCC with perl5.004_68.
Note that the 2.8.0 Mingw32 port does not work, because the GUI parts of the 
include files and import libraries supplied with it are not correct enough
to build Tk. The 2.8.1 port may work I have not tried it yet.

Goal of 800.* is to incorporate native look-and-feel to Win32 port introduced
in tk8.0 while retaining as much of the perl-level API as it exists in Tk40?.*
as possible.
