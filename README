This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.0.5 (Scriptics's production release). 

It also includes all the C code parts of Ioi Kim Lam's Tix4.1.0.006 release.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

This version also contains re-worked Image code based on tcl/tk Img extension

This version (Tk800.014) requires perl5.005 or later on Win32 
and 5.004_04 or later on UNIX.

Tk800.014 should build and run on Windows NT using Visual C++, Borland, 
or with the Mingw32 port of GCC with perl5.005 or later.
Can be built using ActiveState's binrary distribution 
(see README-ActiveState.txt).

The Mingw32 builds are stable now.

I have not tried a Borland build recently.

Goal of 800.* is to incorporate native look-and-feel to Win32 port introduced
in tk8.0 while retaining as much of the perl-level API as it exists in Tk40?.*
as possible.

Author has built against:
  Perl5.00503
   SPARC Solaris2.6, gcc-2.8.1
  Perl5.00503
   NT4.0 SP3, Mingw32/EGCS 1.1.1
