o Canvas.pod

	o perlized TCL term to perlish notation

	o added a very terse describtion of default bindings

tk8pod 800_003.9

o tidypod:
	fix unnecessary usage of E<gt> to get more readable out
	put and to save some bits :-)

	Nick should do it.

tk8pod 800_003.8

o Changes:

	L<Tk::Widget> class  (, and the L<Tk::Wm> class.)?

  to

	L<Tk::Widget|Tk::Widget> class  (, and the L<Tk::Wm|Tk::Wm> class.)?

  so pod2man gives right output.
