Everything IMO of course, Achim.

################## TO DO in documentation ##########################

STILL TCLISH:
	getOpenFile
	...

Geometry manager:

	o use save style SYNOPSIS and KEYWORDS' section

	o gridSize  $master not managed by grid return (0,0) not
		documented (intentional)?
	o Form:
		o check/verify/understand I<anchor_point> syntax:
		  	'%$a'  could only work with dyn. var. not lex.
			\$a  man->pod error?
		o make undocumented/partial impl. 'spring' invisible
		  and a add TODO ???
		o add a intro I<-side>, I<-side>B<spring>, -pad<side> so one
		  faster sees what's going on 
		o check TRUE FALSE return of formCheck
		o try formGrid.  the description seem wrong. Missing 'not'?
		o check form(-top... -left...) != form(-left...-top...)
		o ABREVIATIONS "-0", versus -0  wasn't there something about
		  that on p5p?

	o grid mention raise lower to change stacking order.  Works for non
	  toplevel too.   Try it.  (add links for raise lower)

	o Add a ptkmgr.pod  explaining common stuff (e.g., possible
	  $master's, command 'submethods' mgr, mgrForget, mgrInfo)
	  mention manager (wm for toplevels: are there similar wmForget
	  etc. methods, seams useful).   *Propagate,
	  Raise Lower explanations.   $master <=> widgettree correlation

composite:

	o note that ..$opt=delete $args->{-opt}.. handles const.
	  only options is confusing. a) There would not be a
	  'readonly' option as for -class, visual, ... 
	  Using CreateArgs does not work for composites, cries
	  for a support method  (where=READONLY in configspec?)
	o Add skeleton of a Frame based composite?

callbacks:

	o IMO remove BUGs section closure are not 'the' solution
	  especially they are not (?) useable in ClassInit
	o add some more 'normal' callback examples.
	o 'pronouce' that the actual arguments list passed to a
	   callback may differ. 
	o Then concentate 'special' handling of a bind callback in
	  it's own section.
	o Describe how emulate bind in your callback handling
	o Ev() example/explanations better moved to Tk::bind ?
	o BUGS entry?: Missing is a -callback switch that treats
	  callbacks as bind does automaticly

configspec:

	o SETMETHOD, GETMETHOD undocumented (check Derived.pm
          for more)

Configure:

	o detail about composite widgets are distributed in the
	  docs. Bundle them into a separate section. First discribe
	  general interface then go into details about composite:

	o Add section with details about Tk::Configure->new

DItem:
	o pod markup of ITEM OPTIONS and STYLE OPTIONS is
	  wrong but fix would conflict with pending
	  Config:,Name:,Class  change

	o all STANARD OPTIONS still use res. name not option name

	o remove C<>

Text:

    * Intentional(?):
	o Tag and Tags not documented (doc for Text::Tag?)
	o TIE interface undocumented 

    * Go through EMB IMAGE and image method stuff


############# BUGS/MISSING FEATURE ###################

Text: 
=====

o windowCreate -create requires pathname as
  return value (as documented) but should also
   accepts

ptksh> $t=$mw->Text->pack
ptksh> $t->windowCreate('1.0', -create=>sub{$t->Button(-text,'xxx')}) 
ptksh> Tk::Error: bad window path name "Tk::Button=HASH(0x1404b4d28)"
  at /home/ach/perl/5.004_63/site/auto/Tk/Error.al line 13.

  Fix Text.pod when $w is also okay.

o windowNames return path of emb. widgets.  So IMO there's a
  windowObjects|Refs missing returning the ref to the widgets

o Missing (intentional?) Tk::submethods

	x|yview => [ qw(moveto scroll) ]

  a specialcase for  x|yviewPickplace ??????????

o sub Tag; and sub Tags; predeclared.  Isn't this be done
  by autosplit.ix and AutoLoader ?

TList:
======

o Click on 'one' in example at the end does not make it 'one'
  the 'active item
