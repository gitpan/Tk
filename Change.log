	Typo's in menu support

Change 591 on 1998/02/20 by nick@ni-s

	Part 1 of menu.tcl -> Menu.pm updates - so far we have most of 
	grab avoidance on non-unix - which may be why Win32 menus behave oddly.

	Remove old libxpm based Pixmap completely now we have Tix and Img versions

Change 589 on 1998/02/18 by nick@pluto

	they are more-similar than I thought.

Change 582 on 1998/02/15 by nick@ni-s

	MANIFEST update

Change 581 on 1998/02/15 by nick@ni-s

	finds some other DllMain.
	Add prototypes to tkGlue, which discovered bug in that 
	newSV() takes args (unlike newAV and newHV)

Change 579 on 1998/02/15 by nick@borland

	Don't ckfree() and Arg`

	Fix MMutil to find perl in borland/dmake world
	Add HINSTANCE finder func to WinInt and pull that in 
	in WinNotify. Arg-ify tkWinEmbed.
	Now runs large slab of demos/widget - but not basic demo.
	Menus seem to cause segfaults as does HList and text search.

Change 567 on 1998/02/12 by nick@pluto

	Leak fixes and blink Win32 'Eval' removal

Change 566 on 1998/02/11 by nick@camel

	Use Tcl_Alloc & co. to direct Tk's malloc/free to
	routines in tkGlue which use same malloc as perl.
	Worry was we had malloc / free mismatch. But seems
	we are leaking SVs in a major way.

Change 565 on 1998/02/11 by nick@ni-s

	Seems new Tcl_Obj have refcount of 0, so make SV's etc. we 
	create in their place 'mortal'.

	Finish DString removal 

Change 563 on 1998/02/11 by nick@pluto

	Need not, and can not set binary mode on UNIX.

Change 561 on 1998/02/10 by nick@ni-s

	Worst problems with finding cascade menus by name worked round.
	Still a problem when destroying as menu's tkwin is NULL.
	Perhaps objects were better after all.

	FileHandlers don't exist on Win32, so we had better
	do without them altogether. Time to look at channels ?

Change 546 on 1998/02/08 by nick@camel

	Win32-isms - in particular "selection exists" is no longer
	in tcltk, and property listing is not supported and we have
	and issue with convert to/from X selection form which needs
	following up.

Change 545 on 1998/02/08 by nick@camel
