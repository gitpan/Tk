Change 772 on 1998/04/18 by nick@ni-s

	Tweak Lang_SplitList() to be more-like Tcl_ListObjGetElements(),

	Use ERRSV rather than groping about for $@ (which is wrong threaded)

Change 762 on 1998/04/14 by nick@ni-s

	Partial re-work of error reporting, probably a blink alley.
	I _think_ we should just use $@ and warp Tk error reporting to

	Work-round Win32 Font code trying to 'split' a read-only string

Change 645 on 1998/03/06 by nick@ni-s

	If a Tk::Derived widget does not have default value, and
	configure is used to inquire the default, then ask delegate
	widget(s) for the default. e.g. restoring default background
	in Scrolled Text widget in the demos.

Change 644 on 1998/03/06 by nick@ni-s

Change 640 on 1998/03/06 by nick@ni-s

	Achim Bohnet <ach@mpe.mpg.de>
	Patch below has IMO 'useful cosmetic' changes for -w and strict checks
	so it's easier to spot possible errors
	
	o remove use AutoLoader when there's almost/ nothing to
	  autoload
	  Here I was not sure:
		X.pm: uses AutoLoader as fallback in it's own
			autoload routine but there's nothing to
			autoload.  Remove ???
		Toplevel.pm:  Only Autoloads Icon (and sub Icon
			has require Tk::Toplevel.  Why ???
	o ClassInit not autoloaded.
		Text, Scrollbar, Listbox still have ClassInit
		autoloaded.  I guess it's also no win here.
	o @ISA @EXPORT(_OK)? into use vars
	o Fixed one wrong $VERSION/package order in Radiobutton
	o added require Whatever before @ISA = Whatever

Change 639 on 1998/03/06 by nick@ni-s

	Make Name => handling in Tk::Widget::new more generic so that 
	menu -label values can be passed. Do so in Tk::Menu::Cascade
	so that a Help entry gets a menu called "help" and is 
	hence shown on the right.

Change 638 on 1998/03/05 by nick@pluto

	Move fileevent into Tk::IO.
	Re-work XSUB'ing of Tcl_CreateFileHandler and Tcl_DeleteFileHandler
	Make Tk::IO a TIEHANDLE package so that we can catch close.

Change 622 on 1998/02/28 by nick@camel

	Tweak toyedit to avoid DragDrop till we
	either avoid Tix's wmRelease or make it work on Win32

Change 621 on 1998/02/28 by nick@ni-s

	First attempt at mapping Menubar onto a real one now they exist.

Change 620 on 1998/02/28 by nick@ni-s

	Use <<Copy>> & co. new method in Tk/Clipboard.pm to use them
	code in MainWindow.pm to define them. Testing revealed Listbox Copy
	not working as expected due to name mis-match Getselected vs getSelected
	standardize on latter for symetry with other clipboard stuff.

Change 619 on 1998/02/28 by nick@camel

	Contrib tweak to eventGenerate 

Change 611 on 1998/02/27 by nick@pluto

	Use sv_setpvfn(), remove debug in palette stuff, beginings of event?

Change 610 on 1998/02/26 by nick@ni-s

	Re-work mechanism for returning result(s) from Tk to perl to be essentially
	same as it was prior to Tk8 merge. Instead of trying to mimic Tcl return
	scheme in perl, comprehend special case of perl/Tk's 'result' object 
	in objGlue.c. Without this re-work it was impossible to tell an empty
	string from an empty list. e.g. $widget->children returned undef 
	rather than () when there were no children.  

Change 609 on 1998/02/26 by nick@pluto

	Contrib fixes to Menu stuff + one of my own
	Tweak winfo stuff to return list for rgb again.

Change 607 on 1998/02/25 by nick@ni-s

	Slaven Rezic <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de>
	The only event command working is "generate". Here's a patch to make

	Typo's in menu support

Change 591 on 1998/02/20 by nick@ni-s

	Part 1 of menu.tcl -> Menu.pm updates - so far we have most of 
	grab avoidance on non-unix - which may be why Win32 menus behave oddly.

Change 590 on 1998/02/18 by nick@ni-s

	Remove old libxpm based Pixmap completely now we have Tix and Img versions

Change 589 on 1998/02/18 by nick@pluto

	they are more-similar than I thought.

	Tone down tkWin32dll.obj dependancy

Change 583 on 1998/02/15 by nick@camel

	API tweaks for tkWinWm behaviour:
	 - 'transient' deiconifies window
	 - 'geometry' will not move a window that already exists,
	          and transient makes it exist ... 	    

Change 582 on 1998/02/15 by nick@ni-s

	MANIFEST update

Change 581 on 1998/02/15 by nick@ni-s

	Add diff utility to depot

Change 580 on 1998/02/15 by nick@borland

	Add tkWin32dll.obj to toplevel objects explcitly, else Borland
	finds some other DllMain.
	Add prototypes to tkGlue, which discovered bug in that 
	newSV() takes args (unlike newAV and newHV)

Change 579 on 1998/02/15 by nick@borland

	Don't ckfree() and Arg`

	Add HINSTANCE finder func to WinInt and pull that in 
	in WinNotify. Arg-ify tkWinEmbed.
	Now runs large slab of demos/widget - but not basic demo.
	Menus seem to cause segfaults as does HList and text search.

Change 567 on 1998/02/12 by nick@pluto

	Leak fixes and blink Win32 'Eval' removal

Change 566 on 1998/02/11 by nick@camel

	Use Tcl_Alloc & co. to direct Tk's malloc/free to
	routines in tkGlue which use same malloc as perl.
	Worry was we had malloc / free mismatch. But seems
	we are leaking SVs in a major way.

Change 565 on 1998/02/11 by nick@ni-s

	Seems new Tcl_Obj have refcount of 0, so make SV's etc. we 
	create in their place 'mortal'.

Change 564 on 1998/02/11 by nick@ni-s

	Finish DString removal

Change 561 on 1998/02/10 by nick@ni-s

	Worst problems with finding cascade menus by name worked round.
	Still a problem when destroying as menu's tkwin is NULL.
	Perhaps objects were better after all.

Change 560 on 1998/02/10 by nick@camel
