Ah yes, a side effect of the renaming (for Digital Unix).  My mistake.
Larry, could you add this for 5.002 (assuming you want to keep the 
renaming and haven't come up with a better new name:-)

	make regen_headers
(or manually run embed.pl)
since I recently took out the automatic regeneration of the .h files
when they were out of date :-).
